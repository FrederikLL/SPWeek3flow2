I had big struggles with this assignment. The description was a bit confusing.
I managed to fetch the data from the JSON server(can be seen with the console.log)
but when i tried to Set the State using setPersons in the useEffect method
it would create infite loop of fetching the data(could be seen in console). I
never found a fix for this and it greatly halted my assignment. I spent alot 
of time and tried several ways with and without using apiFacade.js but 
still no fix.
